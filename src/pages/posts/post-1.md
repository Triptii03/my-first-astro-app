Flowers, also known as blossoms and blooms, are the reproductive structures of flowering plants. Typically, they are structured in four circular levels around the end of a stalk. These include: sepals, which are modified leaves that support the flower; petals, often designed to attract pollinators; male stamens, where pollen is presented; and female gynoecia, where pollen is received and its movement is facilitated to the egg. When flowers are arranged in a group, they are known collectively as an inflorescence.

The main purpose of a flower is reproduction of the individual, aiding in the survival of the species.

### Uses Of Flowers:
- Many flowers are edible and are often used in drinks and dishes, such as salads, for taste, scent, and decoration. 
- Most crop plants have flowers, and they produce much of the most common crop productsâ€”such as seeds and fruits; around half of all cropland is used to grow three flowering plants: rice, wheat, and corn.  
- Flowers from many plants are also used in the production of drugs, such as cannabis, bush lily, and Madagascar periwinkle.
