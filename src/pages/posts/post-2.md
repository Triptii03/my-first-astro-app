Cats are fascinating creatures that have been companions to humans for thousands of years.  
They are known for their independence, agility, and affectionate behavior. Unlike dogs, cats often enjoy spending time alone, but they also form deep bonds with their owners.

Cats are natural hunters and are skilled at stalking prey. Their sharp claws and quick reflexes make them excellent at catching mice and other small animals.  
Despite being predators, cats are also playful and often engage in chasing toys or even their own tails.

### Characterstics of Cats:
- The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.
- Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five) and three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have five).  
- The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.
- Cats have protractible and retractable claws.[56] In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads.
